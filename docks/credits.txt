A huge thanks goes out to my friend Chris Wright for helping me test the mac version of the game.
A huge thanks goes out to my best friends Adel and Keri for helping me provide voices for the boss and adishenall gards for the game. I also thank them for helping me choose the best names and descriptions for all of the toys found in the toys folder as well.
Thanks goes out to all of the other Beta testers who played my game! All of your feadbacks were highly valued and welcomed.

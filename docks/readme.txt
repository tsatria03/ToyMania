Welcome to toy mania! In this game, you must collect toys, find keys, and defeat enemies before being able to escape the store.
To play the game, you have to move around the store collecting toys, defeating enemies, and unlocking the final exit. The goal of the game is to find all of the keys and reach the exit before the time runs out.
As you progress, the game becomes more and more challenging. You'll have to deal with cars, guards, and eventually a powerful boss that will chase you around the store.
You can equip various weapons, each with different strengths and ranges, to help fight off enemies. If your health reaches zero, or the time expires, you lose.
Can you escape before the boss inevitably catches you? Let's find out!

Made it so the translation system now Preserves complete keys and values without having to aggressivly trimm the contents of the file.
Made it so pure numbers are excluded from being translated for all language files in the game.
Made it so when a language file is loaded, the game now automatically sorts all key-value entries alphabetically by key. This makes translation files easier to navigate and edit manually.

Introduced automatic extraction of downloaded 7z updates. This is only for Windows users. Mac users are instructed to manually extract the updates, do to automated extraction not being possible on those devices.

Improved the auto updater. From now on, it will check for updates in the backround at startup, instead of always telling the user that no updates are found upon launching the game every time.

Fixed a bug where ammo packs could give negative ammo when the player's ammo reserve was near or above the maximum cap. Ammo packs now correctly calculate the missing reserved ammo, and will only add the valid amount, preventing overfilling or negative ammo gained messages.
Made it so taking damage during a reload cancels the reload attempt. If the player is hit by an enemy while reloading their machine gun, the reload of the weapon is now interrupted with an audible sound and speech feedback.
Upgraded the maximum reserved ammo that the machine gun can reload at a time from 10 to 50.
Added a ping sound to the machine gun weapon to signify that it has been reloaded successfully.

Addressed an issue where coppied and exported stats weren't being split into lines properly for reading.
new in 2.7

Added a voice-based countdown system for the final 10 seconds of the game in level 6. This creates a heightened sense of urgency as players race to reach the exit before time runs out.
Removed the alert sound associated with the boss showing up in level 6. The alarm sound will now serv as the warning indicater for it instead.
Replaced the main game ambience and music with new ones. Credit goes to the producer of Andre Louis.
Added music to the time limited level. This music will play through out the entire level, even after a successfull boss defeat.
Updated the Y key behavior in Normal Mode to announce how much time is remaining when playing the sixth level, instead of the total playtime. This helps players stay aware of the countdown, and therefore better manage their time before the store goes boom.
Updated the D key behavior in Normal Mode to only announce how many keys are needed to unlock the door, without revealing the door’s location. This helps maintain focus and urgency during the time-limited phase of level 6.
new in 2.5
Fixed an issue where the alarm sound in level 6 would continue to play even after the user has either died or won the game.
The normal game mode is now time based. Players now have a limited amount of time to defeat the boss and escape the store once they reach level 6. A looping alarm sound will play during this final phase. Failing to exit in time will result in the entire store exploding.
Recoded the post-game menus to support exporting session stats to a file. Players can now choose whether to copy their results to the clipboard, or export them to data/stats/player_posts.txt. This can be durring or after a game session has ended.
Made it so car bullets can sometimes break keys, items, and toys while they are traveling.
Made it so health related items start showing up in level 2 or higher in endless mode.
Made it so cars will only shoot at you if you’re nearby. This prevents bullets from cluttering up the field at long distances, and makes car attacks more impactful when they’re up close.
Made it so the damage of bullets fired by cars is randomized per car type. Different cars now fire bullets with varying damage specs.
Added machine gun-style burst firing to car bullets. Each car now fires in bursts of multiple bullets at a rapid speed, followed by a cooldown between bursts.

Added some more car and player related sounds into the learn game sounds menu.
new in 2.4

Made it so your inventory gets reset upon starting a new game in endless mode.
Adjusted some hitting sounds for bosses and guards.
Fixed a bug where the sounds of health related items would still play even after a game has ended in endless mode.
new in 2.3

This adds stability and makes level advancements more predictable during long Endless Mode runs.
Added a sound count indicator to each category in the Learn game Sounds menu. Players can now see how many sounds are available in each category before entering the menu. This helps estimate the size of each group of sounds and improves overall navigation and clarity.
Fixed a bug where the key requirement for unlocking doors would randomly change every time the player interacted with them. The required number of keys is now determined when the door is spawned and remains consistent throughout the session.
Made it so door requirements are randomized between 15-30 keys for the normal game mode, and 30-60 keys for the endless game mode to unlock it.

The endless game Mode has now been completely rebalanced to match the Normal game Mode for the first 6 levels. This offers a gradual and familiar introduction before the difficulty of the game increases. After level 6, the mode will start ramping up with more enemies and collectibles.
Adjusted the Endless Mode progression for better difficulty scaling. Previously, the Endless Mode would overwhelm players early on by spawning guards, cars, and keys all at once.
Added a keyboard shortcut to check the position of the winning door in endless mode. This shortcut is also mentioned in the readme file as well.

Added descriptions to the game mode options found in the start game menu.

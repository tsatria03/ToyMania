Addressed an issue where coppied and exported stats weren't being split into lines properly for reading.
new in 2.7
Made it so extra keys don't get spawned after reaching the required key count in all game Modes. Once you've collected enough keys to unlock the door, no more of them will spawn on the map. This keeps the overall playfield cleaner to work with.
Added door distance feedback to the letter D keyboard shortcut in Normal Mode. Pressing it now tells you how far the exit door is from your current location in feet, followed by how many keys are required to open it. This improves situational awareness during the final time-limited phase.
Added an option in the settings menu to enable or disable level-up sounds for all game modes. This lets players choose whether they want to hear an audio cue each time they advance a level, offering a quieter experience for those who don't prefer it.

Instead of being taken back to the main menu, a quick “Try Again” prompt offers a more seamless and convenient way to attempt another run.
Added randomized failure messages for when the time runs out in level 6. If the player fails to escape the store in time, a random humorous message will pop up instead of a static alert.
Fixed an issue where the final countdown voice in level 6 would trigger too early. The countdown now starts almost exactly when there's 10 seconds left on the clock.
Added a voice-based countdown system for the final 10 seconds of the game in level 6. This creates a heightened sense of urgency as players race to reach the exit before time runs out.
Removed the alert sound associated with the boss showing up in level 6. The alarm sound will now serv as the warning indicater for it instead.
Replaced the main game ambience and music with new ones. Credit goes to the producer of Andre Louis.
Added music to the time limited level. This music will play through out the entire level, even after a successfull boss defeat.
Updated the Y key behavior in Normal Mode to announce how much time is remaining when playing the sixth level, instead of the total playtime. This helps players stay aware of the countdown, and therefore better manage their time before the store goes boom.
Updated the D key behavior in Normal Mode to only announce how many keys are needed to unlock the door, without revealing the door’s location. This helps maintain focus and urgency during the time-limited phase of level 6.
new in 2.5
Fixed an issue where the alarm sound in level 6 would continue to play even after the user has either died or won the game.
The normal game mode is now time based. Players now have a limited amount of time to defeat the boss and escape the store once they reach level 6. A looping alarm sound will play during this final phase. Failing to exit in time will result in the entire store exploding.
Recoded the post-game menus to support exporting session stats to a file. Players can now choose whether to copy their results to the clipboard, or export them to data/stats/player_posts.txt. This can be durring or after a game session has ended.
Made it so car bullets can sometimes break keys, items, and toys while they are traveling.
Made it so health related items start showing up in level 2 or higher in endless mode.
Made it so cars will only shoot at you if you’re nearby. This prevents bullets from cluttering up the field at long distances, and makes car attacks more impactful when they’re up close.

Added machine gun-style burst firing to car bullets. Each car now fires in bursts of multiple bullets at a rapid speed, followed by a cooldown between bursts.

Adjusted some hitting sounds for bosses and guards.
Fixed a bug where the sounds of health related items would still play even after a game has ended in endless mode.
new in 2.3

The game now tracks the times between level-ups to ensure that the level only increases once every 60 seconds, preventing the level sound from playing continuously. This adds stability and makes level advancements more predictable during long Endless Mode runs.
Added a sound count indicator to each category in the Learn game Sounds menu. Players can now see how many sounds are available in each category before entering the menu. This helps estimate the size of each group of sounds and improves overall navigation and clarity.
Fixed a bug where the key requirement for unlocking doors would randomly change every time the player interacted with them. The required number of keys is now determined when the door is spawned and remains consistent throughout the session.

Made it so your starting weapon is only randomized when playing the Endless mode. In Normal mode, players will always begin with the bat as their default weapon, ensuring a consistent and balanced starting experience.
Added the ability to draw a random weapon at the start of a new game session. Instead of always starting with the bat, players are now equipped with a randomly selected weapon, adding variety and unpredictability to each run.

Adjusted the Endless Mode progression for better difficulty scaling. Previously, the Endless Mode would overwhelm players early on by spawning guards, cars, and keys all at once.
Added a keyboard shortcut to check the position of the winning door in endless mode. This shortcut is also mentioned in the readme file as well.

Added descriptions to the game mode options found in the start game menu.
